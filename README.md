## ✨ Features  
- 🔹 **Graphical Interface:** A user-friendly GUI based on Tkinter for working with tasks.  
- 🔹 **Task Execution:** Select and run different mathematical problems.  
- 🔹 **Implemented Numerical Methods:**  
  - ✅ **Task 1:** Graphical method and absolute error  
  - ✅ **Task 2:** Comparison of root-finding methods  
  - ✅ **Task 3:** Jacobi method  
  - ✅ **Task 4:** Iterative matrix inversion method  
  - ✅ **Task 5:** Least squares approximation  
  - ✅ **Task 6:** Newton interpolation (forward difference)  
  - ✅ **Task 7:** Numerical differentiation (Newton’s formula)  
  - ✅ **Task 8:** Numerical integration (trapezoidal rule)  
- 🔹 **Graphs and Visualization:** Plotting graphs using Matplotlib.  
- 🔹 **Error Estimation:** Calculation of absolute error between analytical and numerical solutions.
